# KeyphraseExtraction
Keyphrase extraction using Word2vec and Page rank

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)
* [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
* Word2vec vectors trained on Wikipedia data
* Stopwords and topic-file have been added to repository

## Running
```
python SgRank.py
python SemRank.py
```
## Algorithm description
Extract noun chunks using Spacy. Apply pagerank on graph with noun chunks as nodes and edge weights can either be calculated using [syntax heuristics](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S15-1013) or semantic similarity or both.
